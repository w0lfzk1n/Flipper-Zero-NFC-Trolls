## == Infos ==

- *I am from germany, so there are some german-based links. They are marked with **GER**.*

## How to add?
- Download / Clone this repo.
- Connect Flipper to PC via USB, or access the SD Card from a reader.
- Copy all the entire folders into the existing **nfc** folder. *Or pick the ones you like from the list below*
- Access the file/s on the Flippers **NFC** Menu and emulate the chosen one.
- Hold it near a device *(Smartphone/Laptop)* with NFC **turned ON**
- Have fun... or what ever you do :P

Ã‰ voila :D 

## What?

I personally knew a few funny and great websites to browse when you are bored.

When I bought the FlipperZ, I thought *"Why not preseve some of those on this thing?"*

So here we are, all links are documented below and categorized.

**Trolls** // **Funny stuff** // **Weird stuff** // **Helpful stuff**

Using Android, i wrote the links to empty NTAG_213BIT emulated by Flipper Zero.

## How to create myself?

I will quickly summarize how I did it. This method is pretty basic, *duh*.

It can be done more easily, I know. I did not went deep into NFC things.

**Requirements**

- Mobile Phone with NFC App to write    *(Android in my case)*
- Flipper Zero
- PC with qFlipper
- USB - USB-C Cable

1. Download the Xempty_213.nfc or any NFC Tag that fits you and put it on the Flipper's SD.
2. Open the NFC app *(no specific app to mention, just search one that can WRITE)* and emulate writing the link you want to have as NFC.
3. Now emulate the *NFC File* from Step 1. and hold it near the device, emulating the Link.
4. Go to qFlipper and navigate to the folder with the NFC you have emulated.
5. You now see **2 Files**. Rename the *(example)* **Xempty.shd** to your desired name. *Your-Key.nfc*
7. Enjoy your NFC Tag :D

*YOUR PHONE MAY NOT SUPPORT NFC OR NFC WRITING, PLEASE INFORM YOURSELF AND DON'T ASK ME ABOUT THIS*

## Documentation

"*" = My own favorites :)
